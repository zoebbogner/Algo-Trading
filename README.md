# Algorithmic Trading Bot

A comprehensive algorithmic trading system built with Python, designed for cryptocurrency markets.

## 🚀 Project Status: REBUILDING FROM SCRATCH

This project is currently being rebuilt from the ground up with a clean, modular architecture.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Continuous Operation**: Bot runs automatically 24/7
- **Real Data**: Collects 5 years of historical data, trains on 4 years, tests on 1 year
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
- **Professional Quality**: Following Python best practices, proper typing, and comprehensive testing
- **Risk Management**: Advanced risk controls and portfolio optimization
- **Machine Learning**: ML-powered signal confirmation and strategy enhancement
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed performance and risk analytics
