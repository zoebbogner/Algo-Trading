# Project Organization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the current organization of the Crypto Algorithmic Trading System according to enterprise best practices. The system has been reorganized to follow professional standards for maintainability, scalability, and operational excellence.

## What Has Been Organized

### 1. Repository Structure âœ…

The project now follows the conventional, scalable repository layout:

```
Algo-Trading/
â”œâ”€â”€ configs/                 # Runtime configurations (YAML only)
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                    # User/dev docs and runbooks
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/                    # Runtime logs (gitignored), rotating
â”œâ”€â”€ reports/                 # Metrics/QC artifacts (gitignored)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                     # Source code with proper package structure
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/             # Configuration management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/               # Data operations
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fetch/          # Data fetching
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ processing/     # Data normalization
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ feature_extraction/  # Feature engineering
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/              # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                   # Unit/integration/property tests
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
```

### 2. Global Configuration Strategy âœ…

- **Layered Configuration**: Base â†’ Environment â†’ Runtime args
- **YAML-Only**: No secrets in config files
- **Schema Validation**: Strict validation for all configs
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized configuration management

### 3. Global Logger (Structured, Consistent) âœ…

- **One Global Logger**: Per process, configured once at startup
- **Dual Sinks**: Console (INFO) + File (rotating) at DEBUG
- **JSON Logs**: Machine parsing with structured fields
- **Error Taxonomy**: Custom exception hierarchy
- **Correlation IDs**: run_id + step_id on every log line
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance logging decorators

### 4. Data Governance & Lineage âœ…

- **Immutable Raw Zone**: Never mutate once written
- **Full Lineage**: load_id, source tag, code version, config hash
- **Partitioning**: symbol=..., date=YYYY-MM-DD for Parquet datasets
- **QC Gates**: Coverage %, duplicates, monotonic timestamps, NA rates
- **Provenance Manifest**: Full audit trail per run

### 5. Utilities ("/src/utils") âœ…

Comprehensive utility modules following best practices:

- **Logging**: Structured logging with context and performance monitoring
- **Validation**: Data validation with detailed reporting
- **File Operations**: Safe atomic operations with integrity checks
- **Time Utilities**: UTC handling, market hours, time calculations
- **Error Handling**: Exception classification, retry mechanisms, error tracking

### 6. Clean Code Standards âœ…

- **Single Responsibility**: Each function has one clear purpose
- **Explicit Types**: Full type hints and docstrings
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with context
- **No Global State**: Dependencies passed explicitly
- **Configuration-Driven**: No inline constants

### 7. Testing Strategy âœ…

- **Unit Tests**: Fast, comprehensive testing
- **Test Coverage**: Meaningful thresholds (â‰¥80% core modules)
- **Property Tests**: Invariant verification
- **Golden Tests**: Fixed input/output validation

### 8. Data Quality Contracts âœ…

- **Raw Data**: Time monotonicity, positive prices/volumes
- **Processed Data**: Exactly one row per (ts, symbol)
- **Features**: min_non_na_pct by feature, winsorization applied
- **Fail Closed**: Break pipeline on contract violations
